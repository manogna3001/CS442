## Summary and Reflection
Firstly the user will not be able to click on buttons i.e., disabled buttons other than rolls left, user can only click on buttons after the dice is rolled.I was initially not able to hold the dice but later i figured out, making users to hold dice that they dont want to roll, this resets after each turn. After each turn the dice is disabled , resetting the game state for next roll.

I enjoyed developing yahtzee, after developing i now enjoying playing yahtzee game i developed. I faced challenges during holding a dice from being rolled as it was held even for next turn but now my dice only holds dice for one turn.
